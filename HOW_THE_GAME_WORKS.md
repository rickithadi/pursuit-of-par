# üèåÔ∏è HOW "IN PURSUIT OF PAR" WORKS - COMPLETE GAME GUIDE

## üéØ Game Overview
"In Pursuit of Par" is a 1987 board game that authentically simulates golf using dice mechanics. Players navigate TPC Sawgrass hole-by-hole, making strategic club selections and dealing with realistic course conditions.

---

## üé≤ Basic Game Flow

### 1. **Starting a Hole**
- Player begins at the **tee box** 
- **Goal:** Get ball in hole in par strokes or fewer (Hole 1 = Par 4)
- **Distance to pin:** 394 yards initially
- **Current lie:** "Tee" (best conditions, all clubs available)

### 2. **Taking a Shot**
```
Step 1: Choose your club (Driver, 3-Wood, 5-Wood, Irons, Wedge, Putter)
Step 2: Select shot type (Normal, Chip, Pitch) if near green
Step 3: Click "Take Shot" 
Step 4: Dice roll automatically (Distance dice + Direction dice)
Step 5: Ball moves based on result
Step 6: New lie determined, distance recalculated
```

### 3. **Winning the Hole**
- Get ball on the **green** and within **3 feet** = Automatic make (gimme rule)
- Or use **putter** to hole out from anywhere on green
- **Score recorded:** Number of strokes taken vs. par

## üé≤ The Dice System (Heart of the Game)

### **Green Dice (6-sided) - Distance**
Determines how far your shot goes based on the club's shot schedule:

```
Roll 1 ‚Üí Shorter distance, lower accuracy
Roll 2 ‚Üí 
Roll 3 ‚Üí Mid-range distance, best accuracy  
Roll 4 ‚Üí 
Roll 5 ‚Üí
Roll 6 ‚Üí Longer distance, lower accuracy
```

**Example with Driver:**
- Roll 1: 200-240 yards (70% accuracy)  
- Roll 3: 220-260 yards (80% accuracy) ‚Üê Sweet spot
- Roll 6: 250-290 yards (75% accuracy)

### **Direction Dice (12-sided) - Accuracy**
Determines where your ball goes directionally:

```
Roll 1: Hard Left (-45¬∞)
Roll 2: Left (-30¬∞) 
Roll 3: Slight Left (-15¬∞)
Roll 4-8: Straight (0¬∞) ‚Üê Most common result
Roll 9: Slight Right (15¬∞)
Roll 10: Right (30¬∞)
Roll 11: Hard Right (45¬∞)
Roll 12: Hook or Slice (¬±60¬∞) ‚Üê Disaster roll
```

### **Problem Dice (6-sided) - Hazards**
Only rolled when you're in trouble (rough, sand, trees):

```
Rough: Reduces distance by 20-50%, hurts accuracy
Sand: Forces wedge use, major distance penalty  
Trees: Limits club selection severely
Water: Penalty stroke + ball placement
```

## üèåÔ∏è Club Selection Strategy

### **The 9 Clubs & Their Roles:**

#### **Long Clubs (Tee/Fairway Only)**
- **Driver:** 200-290 yards - Maximum distance, lowest accuracy
- **3 Wood:** 180-240 yards - Good distance, better accuracy than driver
- **5 Wood:** 160-205 yards - Most accurate long club, works from rough

#### **Irons (Versatile)**
- **3 Iron:** 140-185 yards - Long iron, fairway/rough only
- **5 Iron:** 120-165 yards - Mid iron, very reliable
- **7 Iron:** 100-145 yards - Short iron, works from sand

#### **Short Game Specialists**
- **9 Iron:** 80-125 yards - Accurate approach shots
- **Wedge:** 40-85 yards - Bunker play, short approaches
- **Putter:** 5-40 yards - Green only, hole-out tool

### **Smart Selection Rules:**
1. **Match distance:** Choose club whose range covers distance to pin
2. **Check lie restrictions:** Can't use driver from rough/sand
3. **Consider accuracy:** Shorter clubs = better accuracy
4. **Plan for trouble:** Leave yourself good angles and distances

## üèë Short Game Mechanics (Critical Feature)

### **When You're Near the Green (‚â§80 yards):**

#### **Chip Shot (10-30 yards)**
- **Best for:** Just off the green, want ball to roll
- **Effect:** Uses only 30% of club's normal distance
- **Accuracy bonus:** +20% more accurate
- **Strategy:** Low trajectory, lots of roll like real golf

#### **Pitch Shot (30-60 yards)**  
- **Best for:** Medium distance to pin, need to carry hazards
- **Effect:** Uses 60% of club's normal distance
- **Accuracy bonus:** +10% more accurate  
- **Strategy:** Higher trajectory, less roll

#### **Normal Shot**
- **Best for:** Long approaches, when you need full distance
- **Effect:** Full club distance and accuracy
- **Strategy:** Standard full swing

**Example:** You're 50 yards from pin with wedge selected
- **Normal shot:** Could go 40-85 yards (might overshoot!)
- **Pitch shot:** Will go 24-51 yards (perfect range!)
- **Chip shot:** Will go 12-25 yards (too short)

## üèûÔ∏è Course Conditions & Lies

### **Lie Types & Effects:**

#### **Tee** üèåÔ∏è
- **Best conditions:** All clubs available
- **No penalties:** Full distance and accuracy
- **Strategy:** Use driver for maximum distance

#### **Fairway** ‚õ≥

- **Strategy:** Get back to fairway safely

#### **Sand** üèñÔ∏è
- **Major trouble:** Wedge only (forced)
- **Heavy penalties:** 40-70% distance loss, big accuracy penalty
- **Strategy:** Just get out, don't be greedy

#### **Green** üü¢
- **Putting only:** Putter is only legal club
- **Gimme rule:** Within 3 feet = automatic make
- **Strategy:** Get close to hole for easy putt
